# WP Interactivity API Demo - Clicky Blocks

This is an attempt at exploring what can be done with the Interactivty API introduced in WP 6.5.

## Getting Started

To use the block:

- Clone the github repository into `wp-content/plugins` 
- `cd clicky-blocks`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Build the block: `npm run build` 

## What's next

I'm just getting started here. Have a suggestion, raise an issue, or create a PR even. I have plans on creating a tutorial for this as well. This won't be the last block I build so follow me over on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/phil_webs) to stay up to date and be part of the conversation.
